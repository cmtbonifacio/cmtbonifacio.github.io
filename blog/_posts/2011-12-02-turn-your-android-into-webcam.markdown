Found one interesting application in android market “Droidcam” . It turns your
android phone into wireless webcam. It supports various video format, capable of
high resolution. Audio support is also provided. You can connect it via wifi,
blue tooth or ADB(over USB). It creates a new webcam device into your PC that
means you can use it as normal webcam with any application. PC application is
also available for window and linux. So ultimately this is the best option for
those who don't want to buy a separate camera.

Here are the steps for setup:

1. Search and Install “Droidcam” from android market.
2. Install Droidcam application in your PC ([Download it form here](http://www.dev47apps.com/)).
3. Run the application on your phone and PC.
4. Select WiFi/LAN option in your PC application.
5. Write your phone's IP address (shown by the Droidcam application) in your phone IP field.
6. Press connect.
