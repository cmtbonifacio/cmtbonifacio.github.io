About

Hello, I am Sanket Parmar. I live in Gr. Noida, India. I have completed my M.Tech in Information and Communication Technology from [Nirma University](http://nirmauni.ac.in), Ahmebabad. I think myself as partially geek, partially nerd, somewhat sensitive. I am hardworking guy and always ready to learn new things.

Interested in Linux Kernel programming, Device Drivers and Open Source Technologies. In my spare time, I hack opensource technologies.

### Current Status
Alive ! ;)

I am working with [Smartplay Technologies](http://www.smartplayin.com). Working on RF/IP Frontend device drivers for set-top box.

Please check my [resume](/) for more details.{% endcapture %}
